# scs-sdk-controller

This Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator plugin is meant to be used by other programs to control the game. It's built on top of the [SCS SDK](https://modding.scssoft.com/wiki/Documentation/Engine/SDK/Telemetry) that is provided by SCS Software.

The program will first create and then listen to changes in the following shared memory file: `Local\SCSControls` and `/dev/shm/SCS/SCSControls` for Windows and Linux respectively.

Available controls are listed in [`inputs.h`](inputs.h). More controls can be added, but they need to match the semantical controls defined in `controls.sii`.

## Building

This project is using the CMake build system. You can build it like any other CMake project by running:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Limitations
- Currently having the plugin installed will cause the wipers to cycle to the max value, and then not return to their original position. The only way to reset them is to restart the game, or send the `wipers0` command via this SDK.
